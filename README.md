# autoeditor
Car Configuration Program designed and made by myself during my time in Advanced Java Programming class.

This project uses Tomcat version 7.

In order to use it, first click on the AutoEditorServer project and "Run as Server".
A browser window will appear with some drop-down menues that are empty.

Click on the AutoEditorClient project and "Run as Java application".

A console for the client will appear, requesting you to input a choice. 1, for upload. 2, to edit manually.
Press 1, and enter. It will then prompt for a filename, this being "car.Properties" and "car2.Properties". Upload both.
Reload the browser page, and select a car and its options.
